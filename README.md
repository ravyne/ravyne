I like low-level programming and writing games. Embedded systems and classic game consoles are fun development targets.

I'm fluent in several programming languages and literate in many more.

Skills: Technical Writing | C and C++ | Embedded | Game Development

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bare-metal libraries for writing console games with Rust:
     * Nintendo Gameboy Advance
     * Sega Genesis/Megadrive
     * Sony Playstation
     * ... more to come
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ghidra, and more about Rust
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about console game development with Rust
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

I'm also an experienced technical writer for all-things software development: platforms, programming languages, APIs, developer tools, and training modules.

#### [Visual Studio Graphics Diagnostics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/visual-studio-graphics-diagnostics?view=vs-2022)

In this section, I detail Visual Studio's *Graphics Diagnostics*, a set of tools for analyzing rendering errors and performance problems in Direct3D applications. The workflow begins by capturing rendered framesâ€“live, from a Direct3D applicationâ€“into a [Graphics Log Document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/graphics-log-document); later, the capture is played back under the *Graphics Analyzer* where rendering errors are examined interactively by using tools such as the [Event List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/graphics-event-list), [Pipeline Stages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/graphics-pipeline-stages) window, [Pixel History](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/graphics-pixel-history), and others.

In addition to the conceptual and GUI reference topics, I created several scenario-driven walkthroughs to demonstrate how these tools are used in concert to diagnose and correct different types of rendering errors. Some highlighted scenarios include:

  - [Walkthrough: Capturing Graphics Information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/walkthrough-capturing-graphics-information)
  - [Walkthrough: Debugging Rendering Errors Due to Shading](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/walkthrough-debugging-rendering-errors-due-to-shading)
  - [Walkthrough: Missing Objects Due to Misconfigured Pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/walkthrough-missing-objects-due-to-misconfigured-pipeline)

#### [Input for games](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/gaming/input-for-games)

In this section, I describe the common types of gaming input devices and how they are used through the UWP Windows.Gaming.Input namespace on Windows 10/11 and Xbox (One, Series X|S). Topics include device-specific capabilities, such as in [Gamepad and vibration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/gaming/gamepad-and-vibration) or [Racing wheel and force feedback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/gaming/racing-wheel-and-force-feedback), how [UI navigation controller](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/gaming/ui-navigation-controller) is used to deliver consistent UI experience across different input devices, common [Input practices for games](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/gaming/input-practices-for-games), and more.

#### [Upstart - Games Revolution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2015/august/upstart-games-revolution)

Upstart is a monthly column highlighting emerging opportunities and technologies for those early in their career or seeking new challenges. In this article, I discuss how computer and video games have grown to an $80+ billion industry, and how game engine platforms like Unity, Unreal, and others have made game development easier and more accessible than ever before.

#### [Hello ARM: Exploring Undefined, Unspecified, and Implementation-defined Behavior in C++](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/hello-arm-exploring-undefined-unspecified-and-implementation-defined-behavior-in-c)

In this blog post, I explore how various non-portable C++ code behaviors that developers might have inadvertently relied upon are likely to break when porting legacy Windows code to ARM-based devices. The article was written during a time when many developers were porting their Windows apps to ARM CPUs for the first time, exposing non-portable code as bugs. Various problem scenarios and their remediation are discussed, with platform-specific details given to aid developers in recognizing their symptoms.
